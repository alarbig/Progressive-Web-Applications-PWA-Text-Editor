  ## Description

The app can also be installed via your web browser so you can run this app even when offline. The interface is reminicent of a CLI interface. 

  ## Installation
  Open a terminal and you will need to run 'npm i' to install the neccessary packages. 

  ## Usage

To open the app, open your web browser and navigate to 'localhost:3000'. This will install the application and run it locally. If you would like to run it already compiled navigate in your web browser to 'https://pwaapp.herokuapp.com/' where it is ready to use!
